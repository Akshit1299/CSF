This mini project is a Portfolio Website built to present my personal introduction, technical skills, academic projects, and contact details in a clean and structured format. The website is developed using HTML for content structure and CSS for styling and layout.
The project demonstrates my understanding of basic web development concepts such as headings, tables, forms, images, navigation menus, and responsive design elements.

The project also focuses on industry-relevant practices, including using VS Code as the development environment, Git for version control, and GitHub for repository hosting. Through this project, I learned how to create meaningful commits, organize files, maintain project structure, and publish the code online. This portfolio will help me in future academic and professional growth by presenting my skills in a simple and attractive way.
