I started by creating a new folder for my portfolio project in VS Code.

I created the basic structure using an index.html file.

I added a header, navigation bar, About section, Skills table, Projects section, and Contact form.

Next, I created a style.css file to design the layout, colors, spacing, and responsiveness.

After completing the basic design, I tested the website using the VS Code Live Server extension.

I initialized Git by running git init, then added and committed all changes.

I created a repository on GitHub and pushed the project using git push.

Finally, I added screenshots, improved the README.md file, and completed the documentation folder.
